# Welcome to the first MAX-Model-Exhange Meetup in Singapore in 2019
Date Time: 
Location: <address> (map)


## Overview

![Image Segmentation Example](doc/source/images/cat-image-segmentation.jpg)


Come join like minded developers to learn how to use an OpenSource image segmentation deep learning model to detect different types of objects from within images, and build a drag-and-drop web application interface to combine them or create new images. 

During this meetup you will learn how to 
* Build a docker image of the Image Segmenter Model
* Deploy a deep learning model with a REST endpoint to a Cloud Kubernetes Cluster
* Recognize object segments in an image using the MAX Model’s REST API
* Run a web application that uses the model’s REST API on a CLoud Kubernetes Cluster
* Interact with processed object segments to create new images
