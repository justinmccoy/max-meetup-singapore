**Date Time:** 
5th March, 7-9pm 

**Location:** 
BLOCK71 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent, #02-01, Singapore 139951 ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/BLOCK71+Singapore/@1.2967926,103.786762,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7b4dee0cac5594e3?ved=2ahUKEwiAyYmtm-XgAhWMA3IKHefoDnsQ_BIwCnoECAEQCA))


## Overview

Come join like minded developers to learn how to use an OpenSource image segmentation deep learning model to detect different types of objects from within images, and build a drag-and-drop web application interface to combine them or create new images. 

During this meetup you will learn how to 
* Build a docker image of the Image Segmenter Model
* Deploy a deep learning model with a REST endpoint to a Cloud Kubernetes Cluster
* Recognize object segments in an image using the MAX Model’s REST API
* Run a web application that uses the model’s REST API on a Cloud Kubernetes Cluster
* Interact with processed object segments to create new images
